### Notes
This project allowed me to brush up on topics that I had learnt during the Prework and also introduced me to new concepts such as working with table views, creating reuseable cells, and APIs. APIs were surprisingly not as difficult to work with as I had though. I realized they are very easy to utilize; it's just a matter of understanding what information they contain. The most challenging part of this project was understanding the logic behind the code given to us in the walkthrough and learning/memorizing how to use it in the future.
